## Mudflap Altimeter Enclosure
This part is a custom enclosure to house an Altimaster N3 altimeter on a Ragged Mounts mudflap mount. It uses 3 heat-set threaded inserts and thumb screws for easy accessibilty and swapping of the altimeter when changing mounts (mudflap mount <-> wrist mount). The enclosure also includes holes for the button/screen interface, pressure sensor, and USB charging. This part is useful for me, as the owner of a single altimeter who likes to mix different disciplines of skydiving (belly, freefly, wingsuit, etc.) in a single jump day.

## Fume Extractor for 3D Printer Enclosure
These parts are used to piece together a custom fume extractor for a Comgrow 3D Printer Enclosure. When printing certain materials or laser cutting/engraving, the process can offgas toxic byproducts into the air (microplastics, smoke, etc.). This fume extractor system was designed to use activated carbon filters, a repurposed power supply fan, and a dryer vent hose to ventilate the 3D printer enclosure to a nearby window. Attempting to keep the air inside my workshop somewhat clean.
